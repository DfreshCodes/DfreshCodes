- 👋 Hi, I’m @DfreshCodes
- 👀 I’m interested in Coding and computers in general. Developing automated ways of maintaining computers through mainly PowerShell scripts. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about PowerShell to manage and maintain Windows environments. I have also been delving into C sharp as of late. I do you know a little bit of Java as I took some courses back in college but wasn't my favorite programming language
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Automation in the uses of it in the workplace. As a well as collaborating about C#, and other languages to improve automation.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
