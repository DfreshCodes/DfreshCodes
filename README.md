This GitHub repo will serve as a portfolio persay of the different types of pragramming languages, mainly C# using the dotnet core platform, that I've been learning. I really like the syntacs and structure of the C# progamming language. 

With various concepts that I will be implementing in my code in order to test and see how it works.

I'm not sure where this whole repository is going to end up but on the way I will be posting stuff that I have learned to implement.

Right now I am fascinated with all things tech and logically thinking. 
I wish I had started this repo sooner rather than later because I have kind of drafted away from coding to pursue other things like graphical design, photography, Getting certified and then coming back to learning programming again.
